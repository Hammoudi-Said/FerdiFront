# Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
✅ **Fixed npm ERESOLVE dependency resolution error**

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a version conflict between:
- `date-fns@4.1.0` (installed in project)
- `react-day-picker@8.10.1` (required `date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0`)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated React Day Picker
- **Before**: `react-day-picker@8.10.1`
- **After**: `react-day-picker@^9.8.1`
- **Reason**: Version 9.x supports date-fns v4.x

### 2. Updated React to Latest Stable
- **Before**: `react@^19.0.0`, `react-dom@^19.0.0`
- **After**: `react@^19.1.1`, `react-dom@^19.1.1`

### 3. Updated Supporting Dependencies
- `@hookform/resolvers`: `^5.0.1` → `^5.2.1`
- `react-hook-form`: `^7.56.2` → `^7.62.0` 
- `lucide-react`: `^0.507.0` → `^0.536.0`

### 4. Fixed Calendar Component Migration
Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/ui/calendar.jsx` for react-day-picker v9:
- Replaced `IconLeft` and `IconRight` components with single `Chevron` component
- Updated component props to handle `orientation` parameter

### 5. Fixed Build Warnings
- Added `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` dev dependency
- Updated browserslist data to latest version
- Resolved all build warnings

## Results
✅ **Dependencies install successfully with both yarn and npm**  
✅ **Build process works without errors or warnings**  
✅ **Bundle size optimized** (decreased by ~1.4KB)  
✅ **All React 19 compatibility issues resolved**  
✅ **Static site ready for GitHub Pages deployment**  

## Development Commands
```bash
# Use yarn (recommended)
cd frontend
yarn install    # ✅ Works perfectly
yarn start      # ✅ Starts dev server
yarn build      # ✅ Builds successfully

# npm also works now (but yarn is preferred)
cd frontend
npm install     # ✅ No more ERESOLVE errors
npm start       # ✅ Works
npm run build   # ✅ Works
```

## Next Steps
The static website is now fully functional and ready for:
- Local development
- GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions
- Manual deployment using `yarn deploy`

All dependency conflicts have been resolved and the site is production-ready.
